### TODO
1. Implement a utility function to print elements of the resultant trimmed tree.
2. Make the main function neat as for the example cases

### Notice
A compiler supporting C++11 standard or newer is required as the code uses `nullptr`. Be sure to compile with the GCC option of either `-std=c++0x` or `-std=c++11`.
